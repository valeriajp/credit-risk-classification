# Background
In this Challenge, you‚Äôll use various techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. You‚Äôll use a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

# Before You Begin
1. Create a new repository for this project called ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/be89d174-5b3a-4098-ad2c-89e8dff9bf94). **Do not add this homework to an existing repository.**
2. Clone the new repository to your computer.
3. Inside your ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4261223b-9092-4c14-85d9-2ceecb17bec4) repository, create a folder titled "Credit_Risk."
4. Inside the "Credit_Risk" folder, add the ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4b5adfb3-e005-4e14-b5c1-291c19e2cc51) and ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9d7b75a1-e3d7-4fa1-a526-6b7f988c04dc) files found in the "Starter_Code.zip" file.
5. Push your changes to GitHub.

# Instructions
The instructions for this Challenge are divided into the following subsections:
- Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets
- Create a Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data
- Write a Credit Risk Analysis Report (included in files attached) 

# Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets
Open the starter code notebook and use it to complete the following steps:
1. Read the ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f6ba785b-8303-4120-8d71-75e5e825372f) data from the Resources folder into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. Create the labels set (![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c386faf0-e16e-4718-bcd6-11453af09b2e)) from the ‚Äúloan_status‚Äù column, and then create the features (![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dfbc60cc-ecba-43eb-80b7-1bb52fe94b57)) DataFrame from the remaining columns.

> **üìå NOTE**  
> A value of 0 in the `"loan_status"` column means that the loan is healthy.  
> A value of 1 means that the loan has a high risk of defaulting.

3. Split the data into training and testing datasets by using ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7e2c26ac-bb0c-473d-956c-8b1989224f70).

# Create a Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data
Use your knowledge of logistic regression to complete the following steps:
1. Fit a logistic regression model by using the training data (![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bc3f9654-6eb4-4012-9473-75de9cd01b71) and ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2ee1f1c3-57d9-4890-8eca-73638624aead)).
2. Save the predictions for the testing data labels by using the testing feature data (![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/398cfbb6-3b49-4929-8f86-c0d527236540)) and the fitted model.
3. Evaluate the model‚Äôs performance by doing the following:
   - Generate a confusion matrix.
   - Print the classification report.
4. Answer the following question: How well does the logistic regression model predict both the 0 (healthy loan) and 1 (high-risk loan) labels?

# Write a Credit Risk Analysis Report
Write a brief report that includes a summary and analysis of the performance of the machine learning models that you used in this homework. You should write this report as the ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c7392cf4-73a0-407b-8813-66746b8f7b17) file included in your GitHub repository.
Structure your report by using the report template that ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2285257b-4903-4cff-acad-030c348c7afa) includes, ensuring that it contains the following:
1. *An overview of the analysis:* Explain the purpose of this analysis.
2. *The results:* Using a bulleted list, describe the accuracy score, the precision score, and recall score of the machine learning model.
3. *A summary:* Summarize the results from the machine learning model. Include your justification for recommending the model for use by the company. If you don‚Äôt recommend the model, justify your reasoning.
